Tim Changes
+Beer
	+Added Keg Prefab
	+Normal Person can now have beer
	+Fixed wander. Previous mistake; I set target to _direction instead of _position + _direction.
	+PartyPeople now face the way they are walking
	+changed depth sorting to use Z instead of renderLayer; better because it applies to children and takes float values.
+Need Assets
	+Beer Keg
	+Beer Cup
+Problem
	+NPCs do not trigger OnCollisionStay with the gameScreen colliders, but only on the X axis.
		Making the walls dynamic with 10000 mass fixes the issue.
